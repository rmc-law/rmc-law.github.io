            <p>I'm a pre-doctoral research assistant at the Neuroscience of Language Lab at New York University Abu Dhabi. I am exploring my interests in the cognitive neuroscience of language, currently working with <a href="http://www.psych.nyu.edu/pylkkanen/lab/" target="_blank">Liina Pylkk√§nen</a>.</p>
            
            <p>My primary interests are <b>language comprehension and representation</b>. Some questions I find fascinating: How does language construct and convey meaning? What is the nature of the meaning representations language builds? What neural mechanisms build these representations? How 'predictive' are these mechanisms? Recent interests include modelling meaning composition computationally. I also enjoy thinking about what scientists mean by <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/science-mechanisms/" target="_blank">'mechanisms' or 'organisations'</a>, and how theories of meaning and theories of the brain constrain/inform one another.</p> 
                
            <p>I earned my bachelors in linguistics from University College London in 2018. During my undergrad I worked as a research assistant on projects on predictive sentence processing in adults and in children, using online surveys, eye-tracking techniques and electroencephalography.</p>

            <h3>Current work</h3>
            <h5>Structured representations in the brain</h5>
            <p>To form more complex meanings, word meanings combine in a structured manner. Can this structure be dissociated from specific word meanings? One possibility is that the left frontotemporal language system cannot distinguish these two aspects of language. If this is true, then when two words are the same but only one is embedded within a structure, we should see no differences in brain activity. We used magnetoencephalography to measure neural signals when people read, and found that the frontotemporal system responded more strongly to structure even when words are the same.</p>
            <h5>Brain mechanisms in understanding modal expressions</h5>
            <p>We can use language to talk about things that may happen, must happen, should have happened... For example, sentences like <em>If it wasn't raining, Tariq might have gone to the beach</em> allow one to entertain a possible world in which Tariq had indeed gone to the beach, as it wasn't raining in that world. This project investigates the neural implementation of possibility reasoning with modal verbs <i>may</i> and <i>must</i>. Our findings suggest that specific flavours of these modals are not distinguishable at the level of brain regions. Rather, factual modal <i>do</i> drove the right temporoparietal cortex more than <i>may</i> and <i>must</i>. We think that the right temporoparietal cortex activity reflects belief updating when expressions are factual but not modal.</p>
