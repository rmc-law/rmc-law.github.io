            <p>I will be an incoming research assistant at the <a href="https://www.mpi.nl/department/language-and-computation-neural-systems/19" target="blank">Language and Computation in Neural Systems</a> group at the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics. I will be working with <a href="https://www.mpi.nl/people/martin-andrea-e/" target="_blank">Andrea Martin</a>, studying language by combining insights from the language, computation, and neural sciences.</p>
                
            <p>I earned my bachelors in linguistics from University College London in 2018. During my undergrad, I worked as a research assistant on projects in experimental pragmatics and on predictive sentence processing in adults and in children, using online surveys, eye-tracking techniques and electroencephalography.</p>
            
            <p>I am fortunate to have mentors help me get a foot in the door of academia. Although I am still very early on in my research career, if you're an underrepresented minority who are interested in gaining research experiences, I would be very happy to share my experience working in laboratories in linguistics and psychology departments, in both UK and US institutions. Below are ways you can reach me:</p>

            <h3>Research</h3>
            
            <p>My primary interest is how language constructs and conveys meaning. Some questions I find fascinating include: What is the nature of linguistic meaning representations? What is the underlying neurobiology and its relations with other brain systems (e.g. perceptual, motor, affective)? Recent interests include modelling meaning composition computationally. I also enjoy thinking about what scientists mean by <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/science-mechanisms/" target="_blank">'mechanisms' or 'organisations'</a>. Here are some recent projects:</p> 
            
            <h5>Structured representations in the brain (with Liina Pylkkänen)</h5>
            <p>To form more complex meanings, word meanings combine in a structured manner. Can this structure be dissociated from specific word meanings? Using a novel design, we measured neural signals when people read using magnetoencephalography, and found that the frontotemporal system responded more strongly to structure even when words are the same.

            <h5>Brain mechanisms in understanding modal expressions (with <a href="https://maximetulling.com" target="_blank">Maxime Tulling</a> and Liina Pyllkänen)</h5>
            <p>Humans contemplate, make, and evaluate judgments about what is factual, possible and necessary. Language has grammatical devices for expressing possibilities and necessities, such as the words might or must. What are the brain correlates of possibility reasoning? When encoutering factual information, activity in the right temporo-parietal areas increased when we're updating our own beliefs; activity in the frontal medial areas increased when we're updating others' beliefs.
