                <h2>Short intro</h2>
                <p>I am a research assistant exploring my interests in the cognitive neuroscience of language, working with <a href="http://www.psych.nyu.edu/pylkkanen/lab/" target="_blank">Liina Pylkkänen</a> and <a href="http://www.psych.nyu.edu/morphlab/" target="_blank">Alec Marantz</a>. I earned my bachelors in linguistics from University College London Brain Sciences in September 2018.</p>
                
                <p>I am interested in how humans comprehend language, and specifically, how language constructs and conveys meaning. Some questions I find fascinating: What is the nature of the meaning representations language builds? What neural mechanisms build these representations? How 'predictive' are these mechanisms? Recent interests include modelling meaning composition computational and exploring the interaction between perceptual systems and social+affective systems.</p>
                
                <p>I am currently applying to graduate programmes in Cognitive Neuroscience. I'll be attending <a href="https://www.neurolang.org" target="_blank">the 11th Annual Meeting of the Society for the Neurobiology of Language</a>.</p><br>

                            <p>Linguistic meaning composition in a given language requires for words to be combined in a systematic fashion that conforms to the syntax of that language. Language neuroscience has enjoyed successes in studying the neural bases of language using non-invasive imaging techniques, implicating a broad network of regions spanning frontal, temporal, and parietal cortices. It remains unclear whether and which regions may be selective for computational subroutines that are syntactic in nature. This project aims to tackle the challenge of dissociating syntactic processes from common confounds such as (lexical) semantic and memory effects. We do so by embedding noun lists in sentences (with structure) and longer lists (without structure). Our preliminary results show that the presence of syntactic structure increased activity in bilateral temporal cortices and inferior precentral gyrus when lexical semantics are controlled with no local combinatorics. Our next step is to examine whether this effect is driven by the global semantic context in which lists are embedded.</p>

                            <p>Natural language allows humans to talk about things beyond the here and now - e.g. how things ought to be, could be, or may have been. For example, sentences like <mark>If it wasn't raining, Tariq would have gone to the beach</mark> allow one to entertain a possible world in which Tariq had indeed gone to the beach, as it wasn't raining in that world. This project investigates the neural implementation of this sliver of linguistic capacity, drawing from insights gained in theoretical linguistics, philosophy, logic, and psychology. Our current findings suggest that the right hemisphere plays a role in updating beliefs during discourse comprehension.</p>

                            <p>Comprehenders can rapidly use incoming information to update their expectations about upcoming words online. <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23273798.2014.995679" target="_blank">A study</a> found that connectives such as <ins>even so</ins> reverse expectations previously set up by context. For example:</p>
                            
                            <ul>
                                <li>Liz had an exam and failed it. Even so, she went home and <mark>celebrated</mark>.</li>
                            </ul>
                            
                            <p>The connective <ins>even so</ins> makes <mark>celebrated</mark> a congruent word in the event of failing an exam. This project investigated the timing and mechanisms underlying the processing of concessive connectives. Specifically, we asked whether our linguistic predictions are immediately reversed upon encountering these connectives.

                            <p>Lexical access in adults has been extensively studied using event-related potentials. Adults' <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N400_(neuroscience)" target="_blank">N400 responses</a> correlate negatively with word frequency and word predictability in context, and have a centro-parietal distribution in EEG sensor space. These two factors interact: the N400 is not sensitive to word frequency when that word is predictable in context. Children's N400 profile appears to have greater amplitude, is more sustained and more distributed across the scalp. In this project, children from 5-10 listened to an excerpt from <i>Matilda</i>. This project has two goals: (i) examine whether children's N400 is sensitive to the same lexical/contextual properties and how they interact using single-trial analyses to (ii) build a model of linguistic prediction in typically developing children.</p>

                            <p>Structure building during language comprehension involves dependency formation (e.g. figuring out who <i>herself</i> is referring to in context). This eye-tracking study explored how contextual information may interact with Binding Principle A online. Consider this example:</p>
                            <blockquote><code>Before she had lunch this afternoon, <mark>Karen</mark> claimed that Henry had educated <mark>herself</mark> in foreign policy of Pakistan.</code></blockquote>
                            <p>It contains contextual information that encourages the comprehender to consider an inappropriate antecedent <code>Karen</code> for the reflexive <code>herself</code>. Whereas, the following example contains information that is pragmatically neutral for any antecedents.</p>
                            <blockquote><code>After achieving a great success in her exhibition, <ins>Victoria</ins> said that <ins>Rachel</ins> admired <ins>herself</ins> for making everything run smoothly.</code></blockquote>
                            <p>This study examines if there is a difference in the processing patterns between sentence types, and at which stage pragmatic information comes to play a role.</p>

                            <p>Meanings of garden path sentences like <mark>the pirate <b>found</b> the treasure was cursed</mark> are often difficult to recover. This is because the verb <mark><b>found</b></mark> has a bias to take a direct object as a complement as opposed to a sentence in this example. Therefore, upon encountering the verb phrase <mark>was cursed</mark>, reanalysis is required. This effect is much reduced/eliminated when the verb has a bias to take a sentence as complement, e.g. <mark>the pirate <b>claimed</b> the treasure was cursed</mark>. In sentences like <ins>the pirate <b>who</b> claimed the treasure was cursed...</ins>, where there is a wh-word <ins>who</ins>, there are two possible analyses: </p>

                            <ol>
                                <li>The pirates [who <ins>claimed the treasure</ins> was cursed]...</li>
                                <li>The pirates [who <ins>claimed the treasure was cursed</ins>]...</li>                                
                            </ol>

                            <p>This eye-tracking study examined whether the top-down predictive pressure to complete an incomplete dependency introduced by <ins>who</ins> is strong enough to overcome the effect of verb bias, which is arguably bottom-up. If it is, then in this test case, verbs like <ins>claim</ins> would still take <ins>the treasure</ins> as the direct object despite its sentential-complement bias (reading 1).</p>

                            <p>Scalar terms such as the adjective <mark>warm</mark> can be thought of as representing a value on a scale such as <ins>temperature</ins> - cold on one end of the scale, hot on the other. When describing something as <mark>warm</mark>, one may make the inference that that something is <mark>warm but not hot</mark>. Some studies (e.g. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?journal=J.+Semant.&title=Scalar+diversity.&author=B.+van+Tiel&author=E.+Van+Miltenburg&author=N.+Zevakhina&author=B.+Geurts&volume=33&publication_year=2016&pages=137-175&doi=10.1093/jos/ffu017&" target="_blank">this</a>) found that scalar expressions of different lexical categories (e.g. modals or adjectives) give rise to this sort of inference at variable rates. This corpus study investigated this scalar diversity effect by looking at whether the proposed inferences arise from a number of scalar terms, as evidenced on the Twitter corpus.</p>
