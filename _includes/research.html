<p>My primary interest is <b>how language constructs and conveys meaning</b>. Some questions I find fascinating include: What is the nature of linguistic meaning representations? What is the underlying neurobiology and its relations with other brain systems (e.g. perceptual, motor, affective)? Recent interests include modelling meaning composition computationally. I also enjoy thinking about what scientists mean by <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/science-mechanisms/" target="_blank">'mechanisms' or 'organisations'</a>.</p>
