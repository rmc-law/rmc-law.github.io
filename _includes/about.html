  <p>I am a research assistant and lab manager at the <a href="https://www.mpi.nl/department/language-and-computation-neural-systems/19" target="blank">Language and Computation in Neural Systems</a> group, working with Dr Andrea E. Martin at the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics. Starting February 2021, I will simultaneously pursue a research Master's in Cognitive Neuroscience at the Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition, and Behaviour. I earned my Bachelors degree in <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/pals/research/linguistics" target="_blank">Linguistics</a> from University College London in 2018. During my undergrad, I worked as a research assistant on projects in experimental pragmatics and on predictive sentence processing in adults and in children, using online surveys, eye-tracking techniques and electroencephalography.</p>

  <p>I am fortunate to have mentors help me get a foot in the door of academia. Although I am still very early on in my research career, if you're an underrepresented minority who are interested in gaining research experiences, I would be very happy to share my experience working in laboratories in linguistics and psychology departments, in both UK and US institutions.</p>
