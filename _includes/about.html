<p>My primary research interests centre around how language constructs and conveys meaning. A major focus of my work explores how the brain combines smaller bits of language into complex linguistic and conceptual structures using behavioural and non-invasive neuroimaging methods (e.g., <a href="https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1179-20.2021" target="_blank" title="JNeurosci">Law and Pylkk√§nen, 2021</a>; <a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.04.11.648390" target="_blank" title="bioRxiv">Law et al., under review</a>). More recently, I have begun to draw insights from neuropsychology and neural network modelling to better understand how neural systems learn and represent concepts. Others and I have also argued for <a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=gCPJFcHskT" target="_blank" title="OpenReview">comparative approach to the evaluation of large language models</a>, inspired by animal cognition research.</p>
    
<p>I am investigating these questions as a PhD student with <a href="https://www.neuroscience.cam.ac.uk/directory/profile.php?olafhauk" target="_blank">Olaf Hauk</a> and <a href="http://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/people/Matt.Lambon-Ralph/" target="_blank">Matt Lambon Ralph</a> at the MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit at the University of Cambridge. I am also an elected student-postdoc representative to the board of the Society for Neurobiology of Language. I am a postgraduate member of St Catharine's College, home to the <a href="https://www.caths.cam.ac.uk/research/tunku" target="_blank">Tunku research community</a>. My doctoral research is supported by a <a href="https://gatescambridge.org/" target="_blank" title="Gates Cambridge Scholarship">Gates Cambridge Scholarship</a>.</p>

<p>Navigating higher education and academia is daunting for many, and particularly so for underrepresented groups. Throughout my training, I am privileged to have had mentors who continue to support and encourage me in my work, education, and beyond. I am committed to promoting access to higher education and academia and to mentoring students from all backgrounds.</p>
