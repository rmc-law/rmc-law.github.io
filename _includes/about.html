<p>I am a pre-doctoral lab manager at the <a href="https://www.mpi.nl/department/language-and-computation-neural-systems/19" target="blank" title="Language and Computation in Neural Systems Group">Language and Computation in Neural Systems</a> group, working with Dr Andrea E. Martin at the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics. Currently, I am conducting web-based behavioural and magnetoencephalography (MEG) studies to study the relationships between behaviour and oscillatory neural activity.</p>

<p>I am also simultaneously pursuing a <a href="https://www.ru.nl/donders/talent-development/graduate-school/" target="_blank" title="Research Master's in Cognitive Neuroscience">Research Master's in Cognitive Neuroscience</a> at the Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour.</p>

<!-- <p>Before this, I lived in Abu Dhabi working as a research assistant at the Neuroscience of Language Lab at New York University Abu Dhabi. During my Bachelors degree in <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/pals/research/linguistics" target="_blank">Linguistics</a> from University College London in 2018.</p> -->
<!-- During my undergrad, I worked as a research assistant on projects in experimental pragmatics and on predictive sentence processing in adults and in children, using online surveys, eye-tracking techniques and electroencephalography. -->

<p>Navigating higher education and academia is daunting for many. I am fortunate to have mentors who continue to support and encourage me in my work, education, and beyond. I am committed to promoting access to higher education and academia.</p>

<p>Inadvertently, the languages I speak are all of the non-rhotic variety. That might change if I managed to learn Dutch. I play the Chinese dulcimer.</p>
