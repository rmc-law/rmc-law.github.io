  <p>I am a research assistant and lab manager at the <a href="https://www.mpi.nl/department/language-and-computation-neural-systems/19" target="blank">Language and Computation in Neural Systems</a> group, working with <a href="https://www.mpi.nl/people/martin-andrea-e/" target="_blank">Dr Andrea Martin</a> at the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics and the Donders Centre for Cognitive Neuroimaging.</p>

  <p>My primary interest is <b>how language constructs and conveys meaning</b>. Some questions I find fascinating include: What is the nature of linguistic meaning representations? What is the underlying neurobiology and its relations with other brain systems (e.g. perceptual, motor, affective)? Recent interests include modelling meaning composition computationally. I also enjoy thinking about what scientists mean by <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/science-mechanisms/" target="_blank">'mechanisms' or 'organisations'</a>.</p>

  <p>I am fortunate to have mentors help me get a foot in the door of academia. Although I am still very early on in my research career, if you're an underrepresented minority who are interested in gaining research experiences, I would be very happy to share my experience working in laboratories in linguistics and psychology departments, in both UK and US institutions.</p>
