<p>My primary research interests centre around how language constructs and conveys meaning. Currently, my work focuses on how the brain combines smaller bits of language into complex linguistic and conceptual structures. I am investigating this topic as a PhD student with <a href="https://www.neuroscience.cam.ac.uk/directory/profile.php?olafhauk" target="_blank">Olaf Hauk</a> and <a href="http://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/people/Matt.Lambon-Ralph/" target="_blank">Matt Lambon Ralph</a> at the MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit at the University of Cambridge.</p>

<p>I am a postgraduate member of St Catharine's College, home to the <a href="https://www.caths.cam.ac.uk/research/tunku" target="_blank">Tunku research community</a>. My doctoral research is supported by a <a href="https://gatescambridge.org/" target="_blank" title="Gates Cambridge Scholarship">Gates Cambridge Scholarship</a>.</p>

<p>I was raised in Malaysian Borneo, a linguistically heterogeneous environment that exposed me to a plethora of linguistic phenomena. I sought explanations by exploring different facets of language research. My undergraduate at UCL introduced me to formal linguistics and the philsophy of language. During which I was a research assistant under <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/~ucjtwyc/Home.html" target="_blank">Wing Yee Chow</a> and <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/pals/people/richard-breheny" target="_blank">Richard Breheny</a>, studying real-time sentence comprehension and scalar implicature with behavioural methods and electroencephalography. I spent a summer at Harvard University studying the development of semantic processing under <a href="https://psychology.fas.harvard.edu/people/jesse-snedeker" target="_blank">Jesse Snedeker</a>. After graduating I explored and honed my interests in the neuroscience of language by working with <a href="https://wp.nyu.edu/neurolinglab/people/liina-pylkkanen/" target="_blank">Liina Pylkkanen</a> at New York University and <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/aemn1011/home" target="_blank">Andrea E. Martin</a> at the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics.

<p>Navigating higher education and academia is daunting for many. I am fortunate to have mentors who continue to support and encourage me in my work, education, and beyond. I am committed to promoting access to higher education and academia.</p>
